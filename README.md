# KeyConcealment

_KeyConcealment_ is an app intended to be a cross-platform password manager that should be available for:
- Android;
- Windows;
- Linux;
- iOS; 
- Browser. 

The intention of the developer is to guarantee functioning of the program on the first three platforms in the list.

## Purpose of the project

_KeyConcealment_ wants to be a very simple password manager that enables users to synchronize their passwords on all their devices without the interaction with any kind of external server to maximize privacy. Anyway, it will always be possible to get the encrypted password file from the app and save it on the user preferred backup system.
At the moment, the goal of the encryption suite is to support AES and a post quantum encryption algorithm to cypher the pasword file, whereas AES and RSA to allow enciphered communications between user devices.
